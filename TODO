1. Refactor ball direction indicator, currently update and draw the ball and the indicator
   separately and we need to pass the window handle. THis is not good design, we can integrate
   everything in ball update and ball draw itself. 

2. Collisions results in change of speed (at least direction), however, we don't update the
   angle. It is OK for now as angle is used only when the ball is not moving, but it is better
   to keep it in sync. This needs to be thought through.
